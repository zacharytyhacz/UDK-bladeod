inventory ntoes.....

	Scroll up - Shields
	Scroll down - Weapons
	C ( or what other key ) - Items


selection mechanics ( weapons and shields )

WHEN PLAYER SCROLLS UP OR DOWN.....

-check if player is alive / player.health is greater than 0 or 1

	look in the shield/weapon inventory system and look in the main array variable
		when scrolling up look in BladeShieldInventory
		when scrolling down look in BladeWeaponInventory

	look in ARRAY(0)-wepaon/shield, ARRAY(1)-weapon/shield, ARRAY(2)-NULL( means only has 2 weapons/shields)
		get the class for each weapon/shield
			get class'WEAPON/SHIELD' . Weapon/Shield Icon texture2D

		foreach texture2d icon, show them in HUD in the order they were in the MAIN ARRAY, 0 is before 1, 1 is before 2, etc
			the first icon that appears is current weapon ( shows power,defense,name )
			when another icon of another shield/weapon is selected, make brighter or less transparent, 
			show selectedweapon.POWER and selectedweapon.DEFENSE points below icon, show selectedweapon.weapon/shieldNAME above icon
				the back ones get more transparent and darker as they go back, layered behind eachother
				when switching from the last ARRAY(number), go to ARRAY(0) so it loops
				

	when the selection is sleeping for 0.5 - 1.0 seconds on a S/W that is not current S/W....
		switch to selected weapon/shield and make this weapon/shield the current weapon/shield
			((((((current weapon - shows up brightest and first on the inventory cycle)))))
		-SWITCHING- do player GettingWeapon/GettingShield animation/functions and 
			make current weapon/shield the player's MyShield and MyWeapon.
				hide inventory cycle ( fade out )
	when the selection is sleeping for 0.5 - 1.0 seconds on a S/W that is current S/W....
		do nothing and return
		hide inventory cycle

WHEN PLAYER HITS C OR ITEM INVENTORY KEY ( hits key again to go to next item in list)
-check if player is alive / health is greater than 0
	
	look in item inventory system fro the main array var
	get class for each item in the unlimited array slots ( potion, key, other item, etc )
		get item ICON(texture2D), if has Name, Amount, if has MaxAmount
	display in order, first in array to last
	selection item is last, next item is first item in array
		selected item will appear in the middle of all items at the top/corner 
		brighter and bigger than the other items( will appear horizontaly)
	if key is not pressed for 1.0 - 2.0 seconds
		hide, fade out
	if player presses E on selected item
		set timer ~ 5.0 seconds to prevent overlapping key uses and potion uses
		if selected item is a potion
			( if heavy potion, do the slower animation )
			increase health by potion.healthincrease
			subtract 1 from amount of potions there, if 0 remove icon
			
			after use...(thrown out of hand)
				set timer for ~3.0 seconds
				disapear/hide
		if selected item is a key
			trace to key's respective keyhole(s)
				if length is less than ( estimate example ) 300
					do animation and do whatever the keyhole is told to do
					set that keyhole to unlocked
					if there are other keyholes for this key that are locked
						keep in inventory
					if there are no other keyholes for this key
						remove icon, remove from inventory / destroy
				if length is more than 300
					do nothing
					notify player that there is nothing to use

AI
^_^_^_^_^_^_^
level design: 
	designers can put in an array in order of how the AI pawn walks around the map when idle.
	node[0]
	node[1]
	node[2]
	node[3]
	node[4]

	the pawn would walk 0, then 1, and then 2 and so on.
